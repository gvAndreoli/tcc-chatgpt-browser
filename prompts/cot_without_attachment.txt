You are a meticulous research assistant. The article text is provided below. File context: {file_title}.
Follow the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instructions INTERNALLY; DO NOT reveal reasoning.
Your final output must be ONLY a compact JSON (no markdown, no comments) with exactly these keys:
title, main_objectives, research_questions, study_type, methodology, main_findings, conclusions, limitations, rationale.

[INTERNAL CoT steps are identical to the with-attachment variant for Q1–Q6.]

ARTICLE RAW TEXT:
--- START ---
{article_text}
--- END ---

OUTPUT (MANDATORY) — return ONLY this JSON (no extra keys, no markdown, no reasoning besides 'rationale'):
{
  "title": "...",
  "main_objectives": "... (1–3 sentences)",
  "research_questions": "... (single string; items separated by '; ')",
  "study_type": "...",
  "methodology": "... (2–4 sentences)",
  "main_findings": "... (2–5 sentences)",
  "conclusions": "... (1–3 sentences)",
  "limitations": "... (1–3 sentences or 'Not explicitly stated')",
  "rationale": "... (2–6 sentences explaining how you arrived at the answers; cite sections/excerpts if helpful)"
}
